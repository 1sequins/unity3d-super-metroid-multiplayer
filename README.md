# Unity3D Super Metroid Multiplayer

Unity3D Super Metroid Multiplayer is an open-source Unity3D implementation of the SNES Super Metroid game, one of my favorite games, multiplayer mode included.

## Status
The project contains a fully functional scene, the first scene in the game. All movements of
Samus are implemented, sounds included. Sprites used were carefully extracted from the original game and from some assets shared in the community.

Multiplayer mode implemented using UNET. Multiplayer mode allows to connect at least 10 users to the game, also a chat is provided inside the scene.

Some demo videos available at my facebook page. [JUMIT LABS](https://www.facebook.com/jumitlabs/videos/1718531265090022/)
